# DeepBrainNet
Convolutional Neural Network trained for age prediction using a large (n=11,729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages, ethnicities and geographic locations around the world.

Files are in HDF5(.h5) format for easy use in Keras and Tensorflow. Model files initalize the architecture and the pre-trained weights.

Due to github size limits the Inception-Resnetv2 model is available here:Â https://upenn.box.com/v/DeepBrainNet
